# React-based-chess webApp

This is a simple chess board inspired from my own personal project [Chess-javascript](https://github.com/Inert-one/Chess).
Though, This one is based on React-Redux, unlike the earlier one (JS). I gave it a new UI and Logical operations has also been changed as per React-environment.
